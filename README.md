# RWMB_math_operator_Field
The RWMB_math_operator_Field class is a custom field extension for the Meta Box plugin in WordPress, enabling users to create fields that perform mathematical operations on other fields. This field type can also aggregate values from cloned fields if configured to act as a total value field.

Extended from the RWMB_math_operator_Field by Kevin Lanteri Kraeutler https://github.com/kevinlanteri/RWMB_math_operator_Field

I use this with WPCodeBox (https://wpcodebox.com/) but any wp code snippet will do. You can also use files instead, if you prefer.
